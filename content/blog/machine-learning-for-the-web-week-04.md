# Faces Among Us

[LIVE HERE, works best on Mobile](https://flupc.github.io/ml4w_HW_CDX/Week4/)

I was inspired by the idea of "The Man in the Moon." I love the idea that we can find so many different people among inanimate life. 

I started to wonder if there were any faces in my apartment, so I set up a P5 sketch that allows me to walk around my apartment and capture these faces.

Below are some of the faces in my house.
