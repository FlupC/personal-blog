# Poster Iteration
I was asked to make the lightbulb a little less busy. I tried a whole new lightbulb design, but it wasn't as good. I ended up shrinking, moving, and removing the filament of the bulb

# Logo and Brand Identity

For this assignment, I started in black and white on a piece of paper.

These are very basic, but they helped me decide I was going to either use my initials PAC or an abbreviation of my last name, CDX. I also am particularly partial to my middle name, so even though I tried it, I really did not want to use PC (it is also my father's initials).

Quickly, I switched to working in illustrator. I found that I was both faster and more creative working within the confines of my digital art capabilities. I made around 25 different options.

The majority of these are OK, but just did not speak to me. Still, I sent them off to some friend's who highlighted very common favorites (but shared the sentiment that I hadn't hit gold yet). 

I was most gravitating to the PAC in the middle artboard, but I hated how horizontal and non-iconographic it ended up being. I moved a few of the favorites to the third artboard and realized that there had to be a way to simplify and combine these combinations of curves and stark lines. Eventually, I hit my final piece. Here are the first iterations of that.

Here, I was pretty happy with the first circular design (made some minor edits). But I was playing with the PAC text weights. Eventually I settled on medium.

The final logo is below. It uses custom shapes for the symbol and Poppins (medium) for the text.
