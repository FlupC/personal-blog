-># Hierarchy<-

This movie poster is really unique in its structure. It is largely overwhelming, there is text literally everywhere, but hectic design actually informs the hierarchy of the piece. 

After the viewer sees the large, orange, <em>Trainspotting</em> title face. The sensory overload provided by the block quote forces the eyes down to the bottom, which is then further brought down the the orange <em>Choose Life</em> text.

From there, it is time to tackle the <em>Choose your Future</em> and massive block quote. 

Without actually providing any visuals about the movie, the quote expresses an overwhelmed, nihilistic point of view, which is shown throughout the film.

-># Grid System<-

![trainspotting grid](/content/assets/VL/trainspotting-grid.png)

For this poster, I felt that it didn't particularly follow a classic "rule of thirds," but had a very distinct grid system. Primarily, it is 3 blocked out grids existing side by side.

I drew dark blue lines to illustrate these three areas: the <em>Trainspotting</em> typeface, the <em>Choose Life</em> block, and the main quote. 

This is a particularly organized, yet untraditional design choice for the medium. Again, it doesn't share much about the actual film's characters or visual persona, but gives room for the quote to breath as the main source of information. 

I also added the purple lines to express some of the intentionality behind the sides and placements of the text. They are just a little less than a third each, if one were to maintain this grid design, they could design a myriad of visually balanced posters. However, in our case, we let this intense quote consume the poster (just as it would consume the characters). 


-># Negative Space<-

![trainspotting negative space](/content/assets/VL/trainspotting-neg.png)

This pieces does not use a lot of negative space, if any. I did want to highlight that the orange around the main <em>Trainspotting</em> typeface is the only large block of color, and it draws the viewer attention that way. 

-># Typography<-

![trainspotting negative space](/content/assets/VL/trainspotting-neg.png)

Using "What the Font?" I was able to identify the main <em>Trainspotting</em> typeface to be URW Heisei Gothic Bold. With that matching the text at the bottom of the poster. This font is used for the most obvious/largest parts of the poster. It is always bold and the artist used different colors to highlight its importance. Not once does it have the same weight as the block quote. 

Using the same process, I loosely identified the main paragraph to be PIXymbols Boxkey Regular. I say loosely, because it is small and resembles a few fonts. It could also be a classic Helvetica or even the same font as "Trainspotting". That said, it is a small text that is supposed to be easy to reach, much like a book. It would be very difficult to assign a unique and different typeface to such a small area. This was done with the thought of readability. 

-># Colors<-

This poster largely uses orange to provide emphasis. Otherwise, it is using black and white to, I think, prioritize readability.
