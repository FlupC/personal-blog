# Lab 1: Intro to Serial Communications

I sort of sped through this lab while I was on a train. Because of this, my documentation is limited and I deeply apologize for that. 

Here, I have a screenshot that illustrates printing text data to a serial port controlled by the Mac Terminal.

For the most part, I kept updating my Arduino code to match the code in the lab and it continued to work.

Again, I apologize for my lack of documentation here, I needed to finish this lab ASAP this week.
